#This happens because computers canâ€™t store strings in the same efficient way they store numbers. Although the values of the variables are the same, the computer has created two separate string objects in memory.

#-1 if the value on the left is less than the value on the right;
#0 if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right; and
#1 if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.
